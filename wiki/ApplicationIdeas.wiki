Here we'll put in a bunch of API ideas that we've been thinking about while developing SoundCloud and the API for it. Here are a few quick ones:

  * An uploader app that let's you drag'n'drop any sound file to push it to the cloud.
  * A file system plugin (fuse?) that lets you mount your SoundCloud account and add files to it by dragging and dropping.
  * A little radio cloud that sits on your desktop (or maybe it's a dashboard widget) and plays music from your dashboard and the hotlist. I could show comments popping up while music is being played.
  * A plugin for an audio editor to be able to "bounce-to-web" and share with friends straight from within the editor.
  * Iphone app. Jiggy could be nice to play around with for that. While on wifi the app could sync the latest tracks on your dashboard for playback on the go.
