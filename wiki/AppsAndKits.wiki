===[http://www.radioclouds.com Radioclouds]===
[http://soundcloud.com/matas Matas Petrikas] wrote a nice visual radio application on top of the [http://soundcloud.com/pages/api SoundCloud platform]. It shows a users social graph and makes listening to new music thatâ€™s in network of a user super easy. [http://www.radioclouds.com Try it out] and read up on how easy it is to write apps like Radioclouds.

===[http://luxtape.com Luxtape]===
Luxtape was created by [http://hinkeb.com Henrik Berggren] & [http://eric.wahlforss.com Eric Wahlforss] during a weekend of code. It's built using the open SoundCloud API, [http://appengine.google.com Google Appengine], [http://python.org Python], [http://jquery.com jQuery] and [http://www.schillmania.com/projects/soundmanager2/ SoundManager 2]. It's heavily inspired by the excellent [http://muxtape.com Muxtape] but uses the SoundCloud API to access music instead of uploading mp3's.

If you want to look at the source code just head over to [http://github.com/hinke/luxtape/tree/master github] where all code is hosted.
